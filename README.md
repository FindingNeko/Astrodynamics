# Astrodynamics
Projects related to satellite tracking and orbital analysis

These MATLAB scripts are a progression of tools I made for class projects in astrodynamics. The early labs accomplish some basic orbital analysis. The TLEtracking script is capable of using data gleaned from two line element (TLE) data, which is readily available for most known satellites, to give spotting data for a ground position. Inputs are hard coded, due to the requirements of the projects.

These projects are on the burner to be turned into more useful functions that can be used elsewhere, probably in python.
